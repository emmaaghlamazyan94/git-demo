Here I go out to see again
The sunshine fills my hair and dreams hang in the air
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair, there's magic everywhere
Look at me standing here on my own again, up straight in the sunshine
No need to run and hide, it's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh or cry, it's a wonderful, wonderful life
